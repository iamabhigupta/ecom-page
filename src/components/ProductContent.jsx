        <h2>KNOW YOUR TEA</h2>
        <p className="productPara">
          The land where India's first tea estate was established in 1836, where
          the most prestigious tea estates of the world are placed, Assam and
          Dooars produce India's finest chai. The breathtaking green grasslands
          situated in the rainforests, we have traveled to these iconic tea
          estates and sampled innumerable cups of chai before we have finalized.
          Undoubtedly this is India's most kadak cup of chai as it's the
          freshest you will ever have. Being inherently fresh, our Kadak chai
          requires 20% less sugar compared to other chai and is blended with
          premium whole leaf black tea to enhance your tasting experience. Start
          your day with this cup or sip it during evening hours, this chai will
          awaken you with its taste, aroma, and legacy.

              A strong, brisk cup which brims with robust notes of malt right
              from the start. Subtle undertones of dates joined with a velvety
              texture of walnuts is discernible around the edges which hums
              along till the finish. Fleeting woody accents shore up towards the
              end, adding to the charm of having a cup of Kadak chai. Delectable
              tones of dried drupes lingers on in the aftertaste, making for a
              memorable experience.
